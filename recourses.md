#### "Neural Networks and Deep Learning" book by Michael Nielson     
>*This book gives a great introduction to what neural networks and deep learning are.
Here you go from implementing a perceptron to building a fully connected shallow network. 
All done in pure Python and Numpy. Highly recommended book to get things started. Link:

#### Chris Olah's blog    
>*Chris has some great visualizations and detailed explanations for getting an intuition for the inner workings of neural networks. 
Highly recommend his articles on LSTMs and NLP. Link: http://colah.github.io/*

#### Andrej Karpathi's blog
>*This guy is just great. His blog posts cover a wide range going from convolutional networks to reinforcement learning.

#### CS231 Stanford Course for Convolutional Networks
>*Stanford course taught by Karpathi. Goes from zero to a pretty high level on using convolutional networks for comptuer vision.

#### "Deep Learning" book by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville
> *Currently going through this. The book goes a lot in-depth, very thorough and comprehensive. Would highly recommend it so far!
Although, I definitely think you should start with the resources mentioned above first. 
This book is targetted more to people that intend to have a career in the field. Link: http://www.deeplearningbook.org/*

#### "Machine Learning for Artists" (ml4a) by Gene Kogan
>*This is a new initiative, but it's looking promising. Don't be misled by the title - 
even though the book might be targetted to the creative AI space, 
the chapters are highly comprehensive. 
The book discusses a wide range of recent advances in AI and a variety of architectures. Link: http://ml4a.github.io/index/*

#### For the serious ones, here are some links to some great books to brush up on your basics:
> "Linear Algebra Done Right" by Axler     
"Baysian methods for hackers" by Cam Davidson-Pilon
